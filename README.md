## About declutter

Declutter gamifies the task completion process, designed to ease the mental load of managing work, school, or personal tasks. Born from the challenges faced during the pandemic, declutter combines productivity with the joy of gaming.

### How declutter Works

Start with a clean room that gradually fills with boxes as tasks pile up. To declutter the room, simply complete your tasks. A cleaner space awaits as you check off your to-do list!

### Learning and Growing

Our team ventured into new technologies such as Django, React.js, version control, and honed our skills in team collaboration.

## Challenges and Triumphs

Transitioning from Flask/SQLAlchemy to Django, we navigated backend complexities. Frontend development in React.js presented state management challenges, enriching our understanding and skills.

## Future Enhancements

- Connect backend and frontend for robust task tracking.
- User login functionality for personalized experience.
- Task editing, diverse room aesthetics, and a points system to incentivize task completion.
- Plan to deploy on Netlify for wider accessibility.

## Built With
